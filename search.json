More about our group’s research activity can be found on our website).\nThis lab handbook is intended to provide an overview for lab members and others about how we do our work, and our expectations for our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge and for important information about procedures and available resources. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please contact Marta (m.farre-belmonte@kent.ac.uk) or make a pull request.\nThe GitHub Pages of this lab handbook is forked from The Fay Lab.",

Unless on holidays or ill, everybody in the lab is expected to attend. Members of the lab discuss the research of the previous week and talk about the work they’ll be doing during the week. These lab meetings are very informal, but expect to be questioned about your progress.\nOnce per month, during these lab meetings, we do a journal club. One member of the lab will present a paper previously agreed with the PI. All members are expected to have read the paper and engange in the discussion.\n\n\n2.1.3 How we share things\nWe use OneDrive. Once you join the lab, you will be allocated a personal OneDrive and invited to the Farre_lab_shared folder. Please make sure you have access as it contains important documentation for you.",

    "text": "We approach our science with a common denominator of kindness. As part of our core lab culture, we:\n\nAsk for help, and share our learning\nMake ourselves available\nCome prepared and engage\nCelebrate accomplishments (ours & those of others)\nSustain a positive, safe learning environment\nAre mindful of our own biases\nPlan with intention, and follow through\nFoster inclusivity within our group and greater community\nPromote and sustain healthy work-life integration\nPractice kindness\nAcknowledge and give credit to other lab member’s work\n\nThough we do not expect incoming members to memorize everything, we do expect members to be aware of the group’s values.\nAsk for help, and share your learning: We are all learners, and most of our learning is done from each other. It is inefficient to struggle through problems alone. Ask for and give assistance but be wary of your time and the time of the person you are asking. You are not the first or last person to encounter a problem. When you identify a problem consider writing a tutorial/blog post for inclusion in our lab’s shared resources, and share with the larger community by tweeting, leading and sharing at a lab meeting, or running a session in the monthly Bioinformatics Working Group.\nMake yourself available: Be responsive to communication, and make time for things that address longer term goals, even when busy. For example, do not skip on things like attending seminars just because you have a big deadline looming (see note below on planning and organization). Note that being available does not mean that you are available 24/7 - this is not expected. Because as a group we value the role of collaboration and interaction in improving our work, it is expected that you be available in the lab during normal business hours for some time during the week (see section on attendance expectations).\nCome prepared and be engaged: Value your time. Be present during lab and individual meetings, and come to your work ready to do your work. Contribute and participate in planning and lab discussions. When it is your turn to run a meeting, come with an agenda and be prepared with questions. Aim to view meetings as events that contribute to your work and productivity, rather than taking away from them.\nCelebrate accomplishments (yours & others): You and your colleagues work hard. Things don’t always go exactly as you plan. Be supportive and proud of yourself and your peers when you accomplish things. We are not competing with each other - someone else’s success does not mean your failure. Share your accomplishments with others!\nSustain a positive, safe learning environment: Everyone learns something for the first time at some time, and people learn in different ways. Expressing that you don’t know something is OK, and we understand that this can make someone feel vulnerable. We strive to maintain a culture that allows for and encourages this vulnerability. Community members should not be disparaged for not knowing things, and in addition, should not be disparaged for knowing things or wanting to learn.\nBe mindful and aware of your own biases: We all have biases that are inherent and can not be removed, but we can still work on both being less biased, and more aware of bias in ourselves and others. Periodically check in on your biases.\nPlan with intention, and follow through: Be organised and adaptable. Things don’t always go as planned and that’s OK. Planning can help you adapt when they don’t (see Come Prepared). Find a program/project management approach that works for you; being organised can reduce stress immensely and help you progress with your goals. Some tools members of the lab use: Trello, Notion\nFoster inclusivity within our group and greater community: Part of our lab culture is that we are good citizens of our community, we take on leadership roles within the School of Biosciences and the University, we are supportive of others in our community during their milestones and we actively participate in Biosciences events (e.g. FireBio talks, NATS postgrad conferences,…).\nPromote and sustain healthy work-life integration: Our scientific research is not the only important thing in our lives, and publishing research is not the only mechanism by which to provide science and support our communities. We recognise the importance of our other commitments in keeping us healthy (mentally and physically) and bring our whole selves to our efforts. Try not to normalise overwork or being busy as achievement or status.\nPractice kindness: Be honest when communicating, accept critical (but kind) feedback, and give the same to others. View relationships within the group as collaborative rather than evaluative/competitive. Don’t take constructive criticism personally.\nAcknowledge and give credit: Working as part of a team, we will often (always?) be building on work done by others, receive assistance with work (see “Ask for help”), and using others’ words, code, content. Include acknowledgement and give credit for those contributions, in all forms of communication. We share content and code within the group with this expectation. One easy approach is to include hyperlinks to the work of others or their social media in your work. This also helps to amplify their voice and work as well as yours.",

Gavin’s office is room 228.\nEveryone in the lab is provided with desk space. Lab members sit either in the lab itself, or in the shared graduate student cubicle space and shared postdoc offices. Gavin encourages people to set up and work where is most comfortable. Graduate students should make use of their allocated space in the shared area but can do computational work in the lab area.\nLab meetings are held either in the lab, or in one of the SMAST-E conference rooms.\n\n\n5.5.2 Key card building & room access\nAccess to the SMAST building, and to individual lab spaces within the building is through your UMass Pass keycard. Typically, you will have access to the SMAST gate, SMAST East building, the lab space (room #245), classrooms, and if you are a grad student/postdoc you will have access to the relevant shared office space.\nThe necessary building access forms can be found on the SMAST Occupants page which need to be filled out and approved and signed by Gavin before submitting to Mike Marino and Eric Lyonnais.\n\n\n5.5.3 Parking and transportation:\nParking at either of the SMAST buildings is free and no parking pass is required. Parking on the main UMassD campus requires a digital parking pass. If you are staff this pass is free, there is a fee for students. Full details for campus parking policies and procedures are on the UMassD parking webpage.
